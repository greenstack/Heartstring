# Heartstring
Heartstring is a template project for games made using Love2D. It comes bundled with a lot of libraries that I find useful, including:
- [Josh Perry]()
    - [Peachy](): Makes working with Aseprite exports nice and easy
- [Kikito]()
    - [Gamera](): Nice, simple camera library that helps keep the camera from going out-of-bounds
- [Novemberism](https://github.com/novemberisms)
    - [Brinevector](https://github.com/novemberisms/brinevector): Excellent library full of vector utilities
- [RXI](https://github.com/rxi)
    - [Classic](https://github.com/rxi/classic): OOP library
- [SnowKittyKira](https://github.com/snowkittykira/) 
    - [Love Error Explorer](https://github.com/snowkittykira/love-error-explorer): Excellent utility for exploring errors and issues without having to set too much up
- [Tesselode]()
    - [Baton](): Provides a nice out-of-the-box control config library
    - [Cartographer](): Helps with importing Tiled maps

Note that these dependencies are included via Git Submodules, so you'll need to do a recursive clone.
