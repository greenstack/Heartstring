# Heartstring
Heartstring is a template project for games made using Love2D. It comes bundled with a lot of libraries that I find useful, including:
- [Tesselode]()'s [Baton]() and [Cartographer]() libraries
    - Baton provides a nice, out-of-the-box control library
    - Cartographer helps with importing Tiled maps
- [Kikito]()'s [Gamera]() library
    - Nice, simple camera library that helps keep the camera from going out-of-bounds
- [Novemberism](https://github.com/novemberisms)'s [Brinevector](https://github.com/novemberisms/brinevector) library
    - Excellent library full of vector utilities
- [SnowKittyKira](https://github.com/snowkittykira/)'s [Love Error Explorer](https://github.com/snowkittykira/love-error-explorer) utility
    - Excellent for exploring errors and issues without having to set too much up

Note that these dependencies are included via Git Submodules, so you'll need to do a recursive clone.
